> Classmate Academic Hub is a modern, full-stack academic productivity platform built for students to manage assignments, visualize grades, collaborate in study groups, and sync schedulesâ€”all in one intuitive interface.

---

## Overview

Classmate Academic Hub is built with a powerful frontend stack using:

- Vite + React + TypeScript  
- Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components  
- Radix UI primitives for accessibility  
- React Router and React Query  
- Supabase for authentication and backend services  

While the frontend is fully functional, backend services (authentication, persistent storage, calendar sync) are configured to integrate with Supabase.

## Features

- Assignment tracker with due dates and completion status  
- Visual gradebook with subject/category analysis  
- Interactive calendar with local and Google events  
- Study group system with roles and invite codes  
- Theming support (light, dark, system)  
- Supabase-based authentication (Google Sign-In)  
- Google Calendar sync (planned)  
- Responsive and mobile-friendly design

## Planned Backend Schema (Supabase)

- `profiles`: stores user data (id, name, email, theme preference)  
- `assignments`: title, description, due date, subject, status  
- `schedule_events`: calendar events (local and Google)  
- `grades`: score entries by subject/category/date  
- `study_groups`: group management and role control  
- `group_members`: members and permissions  
- `calendar_tokens`: OAuth tokens for Google Calendar sync  

All tables will enforce Row Level Security (RLS) to ensure user-specific data isolation.
